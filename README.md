# question-answering-system
This project aims to build a sophisticated question-answering (QA) system capable of extracting information from documents containing complex graphs or diagrams. The system will leverage Google's advanced AI models to handle both text and image data, ensuring comprehensive and accurate responses to user queries.

# In this Project, I will perform the following:

1. Data loading using LangChain document_loaders.
2. Generate text summaries using Google's gemini-pro model.
3. Generate image summaries using Google's gemini-pro-vision model.
4. Create multi-vector retrieval using Google's textembedding-gecko model with Croma Db as vector store.
5. Develop Multi-modal RAG chain for question answering.
